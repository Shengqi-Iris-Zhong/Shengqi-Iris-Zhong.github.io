Coffee shops are my favorite places to visit, especially when I need to get something done. My reviews in this post mainly focus on coffee/food quality and ambience.

The shop locations are scraped from [this website](https://www.latlong.net/pois/us/madison/cafes). Huge thanks to them, becuase otherwise, finding the latitude and longitude for each spot would have been the most time-consuming part of this project!

Mapping the locations also made me realize how many coffee shops I haven’t explored yet. Here’s to more coffee in 2026! On the map: brown dots = shops I’ve visited; grey dots = not yet.

I have excluded the bubble tea shops. They deserve a review of their own.

If you care to disagree with my reviews, feel free to silently judge, because I haven't yet figured out how to add a comment section.

Good coffee. But Hilldale’s traffic can make it a bit hectic.

Great natural light. Packed when school is in session.

Love their crepes. Space is limited.

The location around the square has quick service, but the coffee is underwhelming. I’ve bought beans from them several times, but they were either not fresh or unevenly roasted. Avoid their beans!

A cool little coffee shop! I should have done my homework and learned it's vegan before my visit, because I haven't learned to like coffee with plant-based milk yet. Cash only. There's an ATM on site but it charges a high transaction fee.

This is the one on the University Avenue. It's just starbucks coffee, but it's spacious. The outlets are too loose.
